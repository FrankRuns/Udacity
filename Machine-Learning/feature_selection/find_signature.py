### the words (features) and authors (labels), already largely processed
### these files should have been created from the previous (Lesson 10) mini-project.
words_file = "../text_learning/your_word_data.pkl"

### test_size is the percentage of events assigned to the test set (remainder go into training)
### feature matrices changed to dense representations for compatibility with classifier
### functions in versions 0.15.2 and earlier
from sklearn import cross_validation

features_train = vectorizer.fit_transform(features_train)
features_test  = vectorizer.transform(features_test).toarray()


### a classic way to overfit is to use a small number
### of data points and a large number of features
### train on only 150 events to put ourselves in this regime
features_train = features_train[:150].toarray()
labels_train   = labels_train[:150]



### your code goes here
from sklearn import tree

clf = clf.fit(features_train, labels_train)

preds = clf.predict(features_test)

from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

acc = accuracy_score(labels_test, preds)

### print important features
count = 0
for el in clf.feature_importances_:
	if el > 0.0:
		print(count, el)
	count += 1
