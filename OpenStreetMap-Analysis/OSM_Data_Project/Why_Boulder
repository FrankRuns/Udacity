# Why I chose Boulder County, CO
I grew up on Long Island in New York. I moved out to San Francisco after college and started 
exploring the Sirra Mountain range. Last year I took a job in New Jersey and I desperately miss 
the mountains. I chose Colorado because it has mountains. In my project I query the mountains
in Boulder County and look at the trails and the peaks. I really hope I can venture into a job
opportunity (in data science of course) either in the Rockies or back in the Sierras in the near 
future.

Thanks for reading my project :)
