    <h1>Uber Surge Pricing</h1>
    
    <p>Uber Technologies Inc. is an American multinational mobile ride hail company. Uber rates increase to ensure reliability when demand cannot be met by the number of drivers on the road.
    We can access fair estimate and surge pricing data via the Uber API. Below is a one week chart (Jan 24, 2016 - Jan 31, 2016) showing, in 5 minute intervals,
    the average surge rates divided into weekday and weekend buckets going from NYC's Penn Station to NYU in Greenwich Village. It clearly shows a increase
    during the weekday morning commute and the weekend evenings. Despite those trends, surge pricing is surprisingly volatile.</p>

    <p>A closer look into this data (shown below) reveals an unusual surge in the Monday morning and evening commute. I beleive this is
    attributable to the <a href="http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-2016-Blizzard-Record-Snowfall-Historic-Snowstorm-Shuts-Down-Transit-Travel-Ban-Plows-366340361.html">blizzard that hit NYC not 24 hours before</a> 
    which led to a decrease in the number of available driver's Monday morning. Click on the 'Dataset data2.tsv'
    button to 'normalize' the Monday morning and evening commute data which reveals a new, relatively steady surge price pattern during
    evenings.</p>
