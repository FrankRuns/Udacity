    <h1>Uber Surge Pricing</h1>
    
    <p>Uber Technologies Inc. is an American multinational mobile ride hail company. Unlike traditional taxi service, prices are determined dynamically based on supply of drivers and demand for those drivers in a geographic area. When demand > supply, prices rise to incentivize drivers to hit the road to ensure quick pickups for customers. This increase in price is called surge pricing and is based on ratios. During surge periods, base prices for a ride (based on distance &amp; time) are multiplied by some surge ratio which could be anywhere above 1.0. For example, if base price for a ride is $20 and the surge rate at the time is 1.25 the total price of the fare will be $20 x 1.25 = $25.

    We can access fair estimate and surge pricing data via the Uber API. Below is a one week chart (Jan 24, 2016 - Jan 31, 2016) showing, in 5 minute intervals, the average surge rates divided into weekday and weekend buckets going from NYC's Penn Station to NYU in Greenwich Village. It clearly shows a increase during the weekday morning commute and the weekend evenings. Despite those trends, surge pricing is surprisingly volatile.</p>

    <p>A closer look into this data (shown below) reveals an unusual surge in the Monday (and to a lesser extent Tuesday) morning and evening commute. I beleive this is
    attributable to the <a href="http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-2016-Blizzard-Record-Snowfall-Historic-Snowstorm-Shuts-Down-Transit-Travel-Ban-Plows-366340361.html">blizzard that hit NYC not 24 hours before</a> 
    which led to a decrease in the number of available driver's Monday morning. The below tile heat map breaks out surge rates by hour across each day of the week. Darker shades correspond to higher surge rates. Click on the 'data/wkday2.tsv'
    button to 'normalize' the Monday morning and evening commute data which reveals a new, relatively steady surge price pattern during
    evenings.</p>

    <p>For good measure, we also look at the weekend hours. Similarly to week days, the hours between 6 and 8PM see the highest surge pricing of the day.</p>

    <p>It's important to remember that this is only one week of data between two points in New York City. Collecting and plotting months or perhaps even years of data between many different locations might tell a different story. The goal of this particular investigation was to analyze surge rate bahavior and has shown that surge pricing, while displaying some patterns, is definitely not stable.</p>
